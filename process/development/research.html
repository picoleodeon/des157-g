  <p> In researching about the Spanish Black Legend, I was able to learn much about its histories and how it affects the educational system. In essence, the legend focuses on how Latinx/Chicanx individuals are described in our classes. When you look back to your US history classes what do you remember? You likely remember a very Eurocentric version, that focuses on our great founding fathers and all their wondrous contributions in pioneering and cultivating North America into the great
  country we know today. Most people know that the path to that point was bloody and led to the disappearance of many different peoples and their cultures. What people don’t realize, however, is how biased and discriminatory our histories remain today,
  in their telling of this story. In fact, many recollections of the histories of Spain, Latin America, and the US describe Spanish-speaking people and their descendants as uniquely lazy and cruel. There are records of Spanish-speaking people being described
  as primitive and needing to be helped / saved, when in reality was that their civilizations were both innovative and advanced. These discriminatory histories have affected the way we continue to teach our students and affect the ways in which Latinx/Chicanx
  residents of the US are viewed and treated today.<p> These histories create and perpetuate something researchers refer to as the Spanish Black Legend. This term describes the discriminatory histories of Spanish-speaking peoples wherever they live. This includes
  the histories of Spaniards and the descriptions they receive in relations to their conquest of Native peoples. ¬¬ These descriptions in turn have had lasting effects on Spanish-speaking people today, especially Mexican Americans. The Spanish Black legend
  ultimately ties back to one small mistake by a man named Bartolomé de las Casas. After spending time in Hispanola, what is the present day Carribean, and experiencing colonization before him, de las Casas decided very quickly to become a priest and do
  something in response to what he saw. He wrote, a brief account of the destruction of the indies, detailing what he saw. Despite his good intentions in wanting to help the Native people, his documentation of the people described them as weak and in need
  of salvation and portraying the Spanish as savage and animalistic.</p> <p> What essentially happened is Las Casa created a black and white version of history in which the Natives are sheep and the Spanish are wolves. His recount attributed these cruel actions
  to be unique to the Spanish and perpetuated anti-hispanic stereotypes. When the reality was all countries were participating in colonization and had hand in the decimation Native peoples Jealousy and rivalry led to other countries perpetuating the legend
  further, culminating it into what we know the Legend to be now. Countries like England and France loved the negative description of Spain and Portugal, who were gaining wealth from their colonial efforts. Protestants also loved de las Casa’s negative
  depiction of Catholics such as the Spanish who believed they were imparting salvation. The establishment of the superior and the inferior soon emerged with this and we soon saw Spanish speaking individuals painted as the inferior individual. This association
  brought about ignorance and preconceived notions of all Spanish speaking individuals, most notably Mexicans residing in California and Texas.</p> <p>In the Tree of Hate, Powell discusses this and explains that “...many people in the United States…gained the
  impression... that most Latin Americans are ignorant, lazy and incapable of governing themselves, and that their countries are rich but fallow ground awaiting cultivation by the superior and enterprising people of the United States.” This sad truth and
  these sad ideals continued with westward expansion and instigated the racist treatment of Mexican and Latin American people in the US. Today, we are still feeling the effects of the Spanish Black Legend, most notably in our textbooks. In all, the Spanish
  Black Legend is important especially for future educators to be aware of. Many articles called for reform and action. Many agree that teachers need to be aware of the legend’s role within textbooks and need to edit their curriculum accordingly. Teacher’s need to be aware of any bias they may have because of the
  education they were brought up with and work to amend this and influence the future generations for the best. This perspective is one that I look more closely into as I move forward with my project. To see how the legend affects the educational system.
