                              In class we rapid prototyped our ideas for the project and had another student interact with it. What I found is that my prototype was in need of more error messages / ways for users to know that they were clicking on the wrong buttons or didn't know which button in the timeline to click on first. Overall, this was a helpful exercise in make sure my project was interacting correctly. </p>
